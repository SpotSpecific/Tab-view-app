What is the 'Tab View' app?
------------
The 'Tab View' app is a simple demonstration of how to build a flexible user interface for a mobile app using the [Spot Specific mobile app authoring system](http://www.spotspecific.com/).

Apps built using this layout as a starting point can be output to Android and iOS.

How do I use the code?
------------
The code here is intended to be used along with the corresponding 'Library app', which is available to all Spot Specific customers. This app can be cloned into a user account and used as a starting point for later development.

Where can I find out more?
------------
We've put together [corresponding documentation](http://help.spotspecific.com/help/A_la_Carte:_Tab_view_app) at the Spot Specific help wiki. This documentation details how the app is structured, what styling hooks are available to change the tab view's look-and-feel, and gives technical information about how the views work.

Can I distribute this code?
